🌍 Global Disaster Response Analysis Dashboard (2018–2024)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes global disaster events from 2018 to 2024. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand disaster trends, assess impact severity, and evaluate the effectiveness of response efforts using data-driven insights.

The analysis covers multiple disaster types such as earthquakes, floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and industrial accidents, focusing on casualties, economic losses, response time, aid distribution, and recovery performance.

🎯 Objectives

The dashboard aims to:

Identify disaster-prone countries and regions

Analyze deadliest and costliest disaster types

Study the relationship between response time and recovery duration

Evaluate whether higher aid improves response efficiency

Detect underperforming response areas

Track disaster trends from 2018–2024

Support better disaster preparedness and resource allocation

📊 Key KPIs

The dashboard tracks the following metrics:

Total number of disasters

Countries affected

Total casualties

Total economic loss (USD)

Average response time (hours)

Total aid distributed (USD)

Average recovery duration (days)

Average response efficiency score

Deadliest disaster types

Costliest disaster types
